**Mission:** Portable, practical PoCs for L2/L3/L4 observability â€“ shadow sampling, TPROXY, eBPF â€“ with out-of-band correlation to L7.

- **Public (monorepo ~~`cisco-grade-observability-labs/public/`~~)**: high-level docs, plans, Grafana dashboards, safe demos, and interface facades.
- **Private (invite-only, ~~`cisco-grade-observability-labs/private/`~~)**: deep dataplane PoCs, privileged IaC, agent binaries, and benchmark rigs.
- **Results:** clear write-ups (EN), reproducible artifacts, and benchmarks.

**Start here:** `cisco-grade-observability-labs/public/`

**Private areas (by invitation):**
- ðŸ”’ `private/agent` â€” dataplane runner
- ðŸ”’ `private/infra` â€” Helm / OpenTofu / Pulumi with privileged values
- ðŸ”’ `private/poc/*` â€” A/B/C PoCs and Joiner implementations

Request access: brief profile + interests (dataplane / telemetry / performance).
